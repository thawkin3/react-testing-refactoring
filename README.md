# React Testing and Refactoring

The app contains a simple counter component used to demonstrate how easy or difficult it is to test and refactor the code using [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Enzyme](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

- `yarn install`: Installs dependencies
- `yarn start`: Starts the app
- `yarn test`: Runs the tests in watch mode
- `yarn test:coverage`: Runs the tests and generates a code coverage report
